1) Since I used a t2.small i only had the EC2 up during implementation and the video

2) The most challenging parts were learning vim for the kubernetes parts, learning javascript for modifying the app.js file I used tutorials provided in the class discord and this [website](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-async-await/) for async function help. The actual coding wasn't too difficult, but because everything was new it took longer than I expected.

3) I didn't removed the config file but it isn't used within the app.js file anymore. The aws-sdk package wasn't added to the json-lockm, but the kubernetes and docker images run fine. I did NOT implement DynamoDB for handling posts. Everything seems to be working correctly besides that function.

4) Video is within the repo
